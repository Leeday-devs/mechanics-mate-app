# Dashboard Login Issue - Diagnostic Report & Fixes

**Date:** 21 October 2025
**Issue:** Users getting stuck on loading screen when trying to access dashboard
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## Problem Summary

Users were experiencing the following issue:
1. Successfully log in
2. Get redirected somewhere
3. When accessing `/dashboard.html`, get stuck on loading screen
4. Only username appears, no other information loads
5. Dashboard doesn't fully load or redirect

---

## Root Causes Found

### 1. ❌ Login Redirected to Wrong Page
**File:** `login.html` (line 265)

**Problem:**
```javascript
if (data.hasSubscription) {
    window.location.href = '/';  // ❌ Wrong! This goes to landing page
}
```

After successful login with subscription, users were redirected to `/` (landing.html) instead of the dashboard.

**Fix:** ✅ Changed redirect to `/dashboard.html`
```javascript
if (data.hasSubscription) {
    window.location.href = '/dashboard.html';  // ✅ Correct!
}
```

### 2. ⚠️ No Subscription Records in Database
**Issue:** Zero subscription records exist in Supabase

**Evidence:**
```bash
# Test showed:
⚠️  No subscriptions found in database
```

**Impact:**
- Even if users somehow reached the dashboard, `data.subscription` is null
- Dashboard detects no subscription and redirects to pricing page
- OR gets stuck in retry loop if coming from Stripe payment

**Cause:**
- Stripe webhooks are not creating subscription records in Supabase
- Webhook might not be configured correctly
- Webhook endpoint might be failing silently

## Fixes Applied

### ✅ Fix 1: Correct Login Redirect
**Files Modified:** `login.html`

Changes:
1. Line 268: Redirect to `/dashboard.html` instead of `/`
2. Line 299: Same fix for "already logged in" check
3. Added console logging for debugging

### ✅ Fix 2: Enhanced Dashboard Debugging
**Files Modified:** `dashboard.html`

Changes:
1. Added comprehensive console logging throughout loading process
2. Shows exactly what data is received from API
3. Logs subscription status checking
4. Logs retry attempts
5. Better error messages with stack traces

**Benefits:**
- Easy to diagnose issues by checking browser console
- Users and developers can see exactly what's happening
- Identifies if problem is:
  - No subscription in database
  - Invalid subscription status
  - API call failing
  - JavaScript error

### ✅ Fix 3: Test Scripts Created
**Files Created:**
- `test-dashboard-detailed.js` - Comprehensive API testing
- `browser-console-test.js` - Browser console debugging script

---

## How to Use the Diagnostic Tools

### Method 1: Browser Console Test (Easiest)

1. Open browser and go to `/dashboard.html`
2. Open DevTools (F12)
3. Go to Console tab
4. Look for messages starting with `[Dashboard]`
5. You'll see exactly what's happening:
   - ✅ `[Dashboard] Loading dashboard... (retry: 0)`
   - ✅ `[Dashboard] Calling /api/auth/me...`
   - ✅ `[Dashboard] API response data: {...}`
   - ❌ `[Dashboard] No valid subscription found`

### Method 2: Node Test Script

```bash
cd "/home/lddevs/shared/Mechanics Mate"

# Edit test-dashboard-detailed.js and add real user credentials
nano test-dashboard-detailed.js

# Run the test
node test-dashboard-detailed.js
```

The test will show:
- ✅ Login success/failure
- ✅ API response times
- ✅ Full response data
- ✅ Subscription status
- ✅ Whether dashboard would load

## Remaining Issue: No Subscriptions in Database

**⚠️ CRITICAL: This must be fixed for dashboard to work!**

### Why Subscriptions Are Missing

When customers complete Stripe checkout:
1. ✅ Payment succeeds in Stripe
2. ✅ Stripe sends webhook to `/api/subscriptions/webhook`
3. ❌ Webhook should create subscription record in Supabase
4. ❌ **This is not happening!**

### How to Fix: Verify Stripe Webhook

#### Step 1: Check Webhook is Configured
1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)
2. Verify webhook endpoint exists: `https://mechanics-mate.netlify.app/api/subscriptions/webhook`
3. Check it's listening for these events:
   - `customer.subscription.created`
   - `customer.subscription.updated`
   - `customer.subscription.deleted`
   - `invoice.payment_succeeded`
   - `invoice.payment_failed`

#### Step 2: Check Webhook Secret
1. In Stripe Dashboard, click your webhook
2. Click "Reveal" next to "Signing secret"
3. Copy the secret (starts with `whsec_...`)
4. Verify it matches `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in your `.env` file

#### Step 3: Test Webhook
```bash
# Check if webhook endpoint is accessible
curl https://mechanics-mate.netlify.app/api/subscriptions/webhook

# You should get a 400 error about missing signature (this is good!)
# A 404 would mean the endpoint doesn't exist
```

#### Step 4: Check Webhook Logs
1. Go to Stripe Dashboard → Webhooks → [Your Webhook]
2. Click "Events & logs" tab
3. Look for recent events
4. Check if any failed
5. Click failed events to see error details

### Manual Subscription Creation (Temporary Workaround)

If you have customers waiting, you can manually create subscription records:

```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor
-- Replace the values with actual data from Stripe

INSERT INTO public.subscriptions (
    user_id,
    stripe_customer_id,
    stripe_subscription_id,
    plan_id,
    status,
    current_period_start,
    current_period_end,
    cancel_at_period_end
) VALUES (
    'USER_ID_FROM_AUTH_USERS',  -- Get from: SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'customer@email.com'
    'cus_XXXXX',                 -- From Stripe customer
    'sub_XXXXX',                 -- From Stripe subscription
    'professional',              -- or 'starter' or 'workshop'
    'active',
    NOW(),
    NOW() + INTERVAL '1 month',
    false
);
```

To find user_id:
```sql
SELECT id, email FROM auth.users;
```

## Testing the Fixes

### Test 1: Login Flow
1. Go to `/login.html`
2. Log in with valid credentials
3. ✅ Should redirect to `/dashboard.html` (not `/`)
4. Check browser console for `[Login]` messages

### Test 2: Dashboard Loading (WITH Subscription)
1. Create a test subscription in Supabase
2. Log in
3. ✅ Dashboard should load completely
4. ✅ Should see plan info, usage stats, etc.
5. ✅ Loading overlay should disappear

### Test 3: Dashboard Loading (WITHOUT Subscription)
1. Log in with account that has NO subscription
2. ✅ Should redirect to `/pricing.html`
3. Check console for: `[Dashboard] No subscription after 0 retries. Redirecting to pricing.`

### Test 4: Dashboard Loading (FROM Payment)
1. Complete Stripe checkout
2. Get redirected to `/dashboard.html?success=true`
3. ✅ Should see "Processing Payment..." message
4. ✅ Should retry up to 15 times (30 seconds)
5. ✅ Either loads dashboard OR redirects to pricing
