## üìù Current Application Status

### ‚úÖ Working Correctly
- User authentication (sign up, login, logout)
- Stripe payment processing (test mode)
- Subscription management
- Chat with Claude AI
- Message quota enforcement
- Landing/pricing pages
- Admin dashboard

### üîß Recently Fixed (CRITICAL)
- Error handling (no details exposed)

- Input validation
- HTTPS enforcement
- Pricing configuration

### üî¥ Still Need to Implement (HIGH PRIORITY)

- Request validation/sanitization
- Webhook idempotency
- Token blacklist on logout
- CSRF protection

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations
- Errors not logged persistently (Sentry needed)
- No request validation (need express-validator)
- Webhooks can be processed twice (need idempotency)
- Logout doesn't invalidate token on server (need blacklist)
- No CSRF token protection (need csurf)

---

## üîê Security Status

### Strong Areas ‚úÖ
- JWT-based authentication
- Rate limiting on critical endpoints
- Helmet security headers
- HTML escaping (no XSS via message display)
- Service role key properly restricted
