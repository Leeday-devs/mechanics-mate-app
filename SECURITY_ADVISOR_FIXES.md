# Supabase Security Advisor - Fixes

This guide explains how to fix the 3 errors and 4 warnings in your Supabase Security Advisor.

## Summary of Issues

### ✗ 3 ERRORS (Security Definer Views)
1. `public.login_activity` - Defined with SECURITY DEFINER
2. `public.failed_login_attempts` - Defined with SECURITY DEFINER
3. `public.recent_errors` - Defined with SECURITY DEFINER

**Risk:** SECURITY DEFINER on views can lead to privilege escalation if not properly controlled.

**Fix:** Remove SECURITY DEFINER property (not needed for these views)

### ⚠ 4 WARNINGS
1. `update_updated_at_column` function - search_path not set
2. `cleanup_old_logs` function - search_path not set
3. Auth - Leaked password protection disabled
4. Auth - Insufficient MFA options

**Risk:** Unset search_path can cause SQL injection vulnerabilities

**Fix:** Add `SET search_path = public` to functions

## How to Fix

### Step 1: Fix the 3 Errors + 2 Function Warnings (SQL Migration)

1. Open **Supabase Dashboard** → **SQL Editor**
2. Create a **New Query**
3. Copy and paste the entire contents of:
   ```
   database/migrations/002_fix_security_advisor_issues.sql
   ```
4. Click **Execute**

This will:
- ✅ Drop and recreate the 3 views WITHOUT SECURITY DEFINER
- ✅ Add `SET search_path = public` to the 2 functions
- ✅ Recreate the trigger for automatic timestamp updates

### Step 2: Fix Auth Warnings (Manual Configuration)

These require manual configuration in the Supabase dashboard:

#### Warning 1: Enable Leaked Password Protection

1. Go to **Authentication** → **Policies**
2. Look for **Password & Hashing**
3. Find **Leaked password protection**
4. Toggle it **ON**
5. Click **Save**

**What it does:** Checks if passwords appear in known data breaches and prevents weak passwords.

#### Warning 2: Enable More MFA Options

1. Go to **Authentication** → **Providers**
2. Look for **Multi-factor Authentication** section
3. Enable at least 2 of these:
   - TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) - ✅ Recommended
   - SMS (requires SMS provider setup)
   - Phone

4. Enable TOTP (easiest):
   - Find **TOTP** in the MFA section
   - Toggle **Enable**
   - Click **Save**

## Verification

After running the SQL migration and configuring Auth settings:

1. Go to **Supabase Dashboard** → **Project Settings** → **Security Adviser**
2. Click **Refresh**
3. All 3 errors should be gone ✅
4. Warnings should be down to 0 or 2 (depending on if you enabled MFA)

## Why These Issues Happened

The logging system migration created:
- **3 Views** for quick access to common log queries (login_activity, failed_login_attempts, recent_errors)
- **2 Functions** for auto-updating timestamps and log cleanup

These were initially created with default settings that Supabase Security Advisor flagged as risky.

## Security Best Practices Applied

### SECURITY DEFINER Removal
- **Before:** Views ran with the definer's privileges (high risk)
- **After:** Views run with the caller's privileges (respects RLS)
- **Impact:** Views now properly enforce Row Level Security

### Search Path Addition
- **Before:** Functions didn't specify schema search path (could be manipulated)
- **After:** Functions explicitly set `search_path = public` (prevents injection)
- **Impact:** Eliminates search_path mutation vulnerability

### Password Protection
- Enabled: Prevents users from using compromised passwords
- Uses breach databases like HaveIBeenPwned

### MFA Options
- Enabled: TOTP provides strong second factor authentication
- Users can protect their accounts with app-based 2FA

## Questions?

If you have issues:
1. Check that the SQL migration executed successfully
2. Verify Auth policies were changed
3. Hard refresh the Security Adviser page
4. Check Supabase status page for any outages

All fixes are non-breaking and will improve your application security!
