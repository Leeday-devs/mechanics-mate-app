## Manual Testing Still Required

The following should be tested in a browser with actual Stripe credentials:

1. **Complete Signup Flow**
   - [ ] Create account with valid email
   - [ ] Receive verification email
   - [ ] Click verification link
   - [ ] Verify email completes
   - [ ] Account becomes active

2. **Complete Payment Flow**
   - [ ] Login to account
   - [ ] Select subscription plan
   - [ ] Stripe checkout opens
   - [ ] Enter test card (4242 4242 4242 4242)
   - [ ] Payment succeeds
   - [ ] Redirect to dashboard
   - [ ] Subscription active

3. **Multi-Device Testing**
   - [ ] Desktop Chrome/Firefox/Safari
   - [ ] Mobile iOS Safari
   - [ ] Mobile Android Chrome
   - [ ] iPad/Android tablet

4. **End-to-End User Flows**
   - [ ] Signup → Payment → Chat usage
   - [ ] Chat quota enforcement
   - [ ] Logout and token invalidation
   - [ ] Login with expired vs. active token

## Known Issues & Limitations

### None Critical Found ✅

**Minor Notes**:
- Database logging currently showing warnings (expected during testing with limited DB access)
- Email service not configured for production (currently just logs link in dev mode)
- Stripe TEST mode active (use test cards for testing)

**Resolution Path**:
- [ ] Configure email service (SendGrid/Mailgun) for production
- [ ] Update .env with production Stripe LIVE keys before deploying
- [ ] Verify Supabase database has full logging tables
